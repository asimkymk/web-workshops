I have been trying to learn software programming languages such as C++,Python, C#, VB.NET, Java since I was 14 years old. I am studying Computer Engineering at Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa currently. This year (2020) will be my first year in this department. Last year, I was learning English at Prep class. I have not been any job yet, but I write programs on my own. Also one of them is VideoDetector has passed 5K downloads in forums. Nowadays, I often search for data analytics, machine learning and AI in Python. Also, I am trying to improve myself about autonomous cars project at OTOBIL Team. In addition to, I love playing football, basketball and Ping-Pong. I like hanging out with my bestfriends.
